How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret the user’s needs, you have to understand their perspective and engage in empathy. What kind of background do they have, what is the purpose of the project, and what sort of issues are the users encountering with the current state of the system? 
These sorts of questions, potentially along with others, have to be considered to fully gain a relevant grasp on what the users are looking for. 
User stories are an excellent way to build a structured viewpoint and facilitate communication in a meaningful way. They will help the team define clear expectations on what is to be achieved. 
The stories will break down what might seem to be complex requests into more manageable chunks, while also applying a focus on the specifics of the user experience.
The user stories will ideally help structure a well put together product backlog that will guide the team in fulfilling the project’s requirements. This backlog will function as a visual guide for the team and keep them on track with each aspect of the project. 
This fits together with the idea of iterative and incremental development, allowing the team to build prototypes to display to the users or clients to receive impactful feedback as the products development is ongoing.   

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

It would be advantageous to maintain a quality understanding of agile principles such as iterative and incremental development. 
This means developing in smaller more manageable increments so that I might regularly reassess my work and have an easier time discovering mistakes or more ideal methods. 
Another aspect of development is being prepared for daily stand-ups. 
This process involves a fifteen-minute meeting in which team members answer three simply questions, “What did I work on yesterday?”, “What will I work on today?”, and “What obstacles am I encountering?”.
Answering these questions openly and honestly will not only help the team but help organize my work for myself as well.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Primarily, you must identify your weaknesses and have or develop quality communication skills to function within a team. 
Staying reserved and attempting to withhold every shortcoming and weakness will just postpone inevitable issues and make them more difficult to overcome.
If you can be honest with yourself about where you are lacking, and relay to that in relevant moments to your team, everyone will be better off for it. 
Opening yourself up will also help develop open lanes of communication with other team members, creating an ideal environment where team members are looking to one another for assistance, rather than avoiding one another in insecurity.
Ideally, this open communication will help cultivate a balance where an experienced team will eventually know the strengths and weaknesses of its individual members, and those members will know where to fill the gaps as well as when they need to ask for help.
Through time, the openness of one’s weaknesses will only help strengthen those skills. 
All of these points are also relevant to the ideas of accountability and responsibility. A team where all members have a sense of accountability regardless of their skills will create a more cohesive environment.
Circumstances where certain team members might feel that they are constantly picking up the slack of others are sure to run into more issues than they would otherwise.
If each member, regardless of skill, develops a sense that they are responsible for taking an active role within the team will help build trust and openness among the group of individuals.
